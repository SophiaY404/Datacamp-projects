This repository contains the projects completed and downloaded from [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/ "DataCamp Homepage"). Each project includes a dataset folder, that has been checked to have valid data, and a Jupyter notebook. Some projects also include an HTML file exported from the Jupyter notebook, in order to capture the visualizations and graphs. Below is a summary table of the projects, sorted by core skill:
