This repository contains the projects completed and downloaded from [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/ "DataCamp Homepage"). Each project includes a dataset folder, that has been checked to have valid data, and a Jupyter notebook. Some projects also include an HTML file exported from the Jupyter notebook, in order to capture the visualizations and graphs. Below is a summary table of the projects, sorted by core skill:

## Data Manipulation & Visualization
| Project | Core Skill(s) | Description |
| ------- | ------ | ----------- |
| **Mobile Games A/B Testing with Cookie Cats** | `A/B testing` | Analyze an A/B test from the popular mobile puzzle game, Cookie Cats.|
| **Naïve Bees: Image Loading and Processing** | `Image processing` | Load, transform, and understand images of honey bees and bumble bees in Python.|
| **Naïve Bees: Predict Species from Images** | `SVM` `Machine Learning` | Build a model that can automatically detect honey bees and bumble bees in images and determine the accuracy of the model.|
| **Naïve Bees: Deep Learning with Images** | `Keras` `Deep learning` | Build a deep learning model that can automatically detect honey bees and bumble bees in images and determine the loss and accuracy metrics.|
